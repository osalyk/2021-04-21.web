{{top "Remote Persistent Memory"}}

<p class="intro">
XXX
- what is RPMEM?
- what is the difference between PMEM and RPMEM?
- what RPMEM is good for?
- what the trainee will do during this tutorial (high-level)?
- expected outcomes for the trainee

{{template "scrollToContinue"}}

<p>
XXX
- introduce what step-by-step will happen during this tutorial
    - ping / rping connectivity check
    - a simple "just esablish a connection" program
    - the final program general idea

{{step "Connectivity check"}}

<p>
XXX
- briefly what network hardware and software components are required
- describe the networking environment (IPs etc.)
- describe what and how is achieved during this step

{{edit "run_test_ping.sh"}}

{{run "./run_test_ping.sh"}}

<p>
XXX
- introduce rping(1)
- what rping does comparing to ping?
- describe what and how is achieved during this step

{{edit "run_test_rping.sh"}}

{{run "./run_test_rping.sh"}}

{{step "Establishing a connection"}}

<p>
XXX
- introduce the librpma library
- maybe put here the schematic showing where librpma fits into the Linux RDMA-capable stack
- describe that the following program focuses solely on establishing a connection

{{edit "simple_client.c" "simple_server.c" "connection.h" "connection.c" "CMakeLists.txt" "build_simple.sh"}}

{{build "./build_simple.sh"}}

{{edit "run_simple.sh"}}

{{run "./run_simple.sh"}}

{{step "Remote Persistent Memory access"}}

<p>
XXX
- introduce used rpma_read/write/flush() operations and
- describe their role in achieving remote persistency
- describe what the example does
- refer the "connection.h" "connection.c" files are taken from the previous step

{{edit "client.c" "server.c" "connection.h" "build_main.sh"}}

{{build "./build_main.sh"}}

{{edit "run_main.sh"}}

{{run "./run_main.sh"}}
